fixed to the ground,
flickered fiercely in front of Brynn&amp;rsquo;s face. Its warm glow suffused the room. He
pushed himself up into a sitting position. His hands were free of the manacles,
but he was still in his cell. The cell&amp;rsquo;s heavy door stood ajar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brynn heard a murmur behind him. He turned in the direction of the voice. Sibila
lay on the ground, mumbling to herself, staring up at nothing. He tried to
listen to her words, but the sounds were nothing more than incoherent gibberish.
He turned some more and froze.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsWh&#34;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;hat book?”&lt;/span&gt;
Brynn asked, trying his best
to look innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know very well which book,&amp;rdquo; Themon retorted. His free hand drifted to
something belted at his waist. A dagger, the same as Arasen&amp;rsquo;s and King Jebran&amp;rsquo;s.
How many daggers were there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;excursion&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;inner&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brynn&amp;rsquo;s stats so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health (3)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spirit (0)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Supply (2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Momentum (-2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shaken&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;excursion&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;inner&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does Themon want to do with the original &lt;em&gt;Codex of Essus&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsAr&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;re you sure it&amp;rsquo;s him,&lt;/span&gt;
Your Majesty?”
Themon asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The king nodded. &amp;ldquo;Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s him. And some sort of monster is always with him.
It&amp;rsquo;s shaped like a man, but impossibly huge. I always see them talking to one
another. I can never see the monster clearly, but him,&amp;rdquo; said Jebran, pointing at
Brynn, &amp;ldquo;his face is etched into my mind when I awake. How did you find him?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsTh&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;he King is&lt;/span&gt;
in danger!” Brynn
proclaimed. Themon involuntarily took a step back, banging roughly into Brynn&amp;rsquo;s
small desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ouch!&amp;rdquo; Themon cried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sorry, High Druid!&amp;rdquo; Brynn apologized. He wrestled away the blankets and stood
up, causing Themon to retreat even more. The back of Themon&amp;rsquo;s knees contacted
the small stool by the desk, and he unceremoniously sat down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He glared silently at Brynn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsPu&#34;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;uffy white clouds obscured&lt;/span&gt;
the top of the
mountain Brynn was traveling down. It was called Abon, the tallest of the trio
known as the Trinity. The others were named Nabuma and Khazu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the winter solstice, the sun would set directly over the Abon&amp;rsquo;s peak when
viewed from Galdir&amp;rsquo;s market square. The moment when it touched the top of the
mountain, the Sun and the Earth became the All-Seeing Eye, guarding all the
realm from danger. The event was one of the most celebrated festival days of the
year in Galdir, with people throughout the Realm converging on the market square
to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsHe&#34;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;e was in a void,&lt;/span&gt;
falling, falling, falling. A
numbness took hold. A finality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then he hit bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brynn expected a bone-crunching impact, but instead he landed with a damp
squelch at the bottom of a muddy pit. He lay there momentarily, devoid of all
thoughts, staring up past the opening of pit, looking at the eerie ceiling of
Grimcairn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsBr&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;rynn&amp;rsquo;s knees buckled,&lt;/span&gt;
causing him to awkwardly
drop Seleeku down onto the cold stone floor of Grimcairn. He was dimly aware of
his surroundings. A large round room, barren except for a lidless empty stone
coffin in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was blood. Too much blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seleeku&amp;rsquo;s eyes opened ever so slightly, thin slits just enough to expose clouded
pupils. She spoke a word so faintly that Brynn wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure he heard it or
imagined it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her eyes closed. Was she still breathing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No-no-no-no &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Brynn kept repeating the word as if it might stop what was
happening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsBr&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;rynn stayed focused&lt;/span&gt;
on Grimcairn as he walked
across the field, trying his best not to the let the gloomy spirits influence
his emotions. As he approached the great mound of stones, he saw that it was
even larger than he realized. To his surprise, the spirits of the individual
rocks had somehow been convinced to stick next to each other. These magical
forces were the only thing stopping the structure from crumbling into the
ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer absurdity of it left Brynn astounded. Communicating with rock spirits
was usually futile. A rock&amp;rsquo;s thought processes&amp;mdash;if you could call them
that&amp;mdash;extended into eons. A mortal&amp;rsquo;s entire life was the merest blip in time to
them. Finding a mutual common ground to understand each other was next to
impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet somehow countless numbers of stones had been convinced into forming
Grimcairn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsYo&#34;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;ou brought back&lt;/span&gt;
a &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt;?” Nessana spat
the last word vehemently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He was in the Hollow&amp;rsquo;s Glade, Scout Leader,&amp;rdquo; Seleeku replied. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;d have been
corrupted if I didn&amp;rsquo;t get him out of there. Once he saw me, what choice did I
have but to bring him here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He could be corrupted already!&amp;rdquo; Nessana shouted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Corrupted? Look at him! Does he look corrupted to you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsTh&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;he spirits can speak&lt;/span&gt;
to you?” Seleeku
asked, her voice a mix of suspicion and awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sometimes,&amp;rdquo; Brynn replied. &amp;ldquo;But just because they can speak to me doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean
I can understand them.&amp;rdquo; He crouched down to inspect the dagger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quarterstaff tapped him on the shoulder. &amp;ldquo;You better not pick that up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

know each other?” Seleeku
asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, not really.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It sure seems like it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It must be mistaking me for someone else.&amp;rdquo; Somehow, Brynn was sure that the
bonewalker thought he was Kodroth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So, are you going to talk to it, or what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsAn&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;n elf? It was still dark,&lt;/span&gt;
but the moon
provided enough light for Brynn to make out the silhouette standing before him.
A women with sharp features and pointy ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An elf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Am I still dreaming?&amp;rdquo; asked Brynn, sleepily. Elves were long gone. How could
she be here?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsBr&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;rynn stepped past&lt;/span&gt;
the Fence and turned for
one last look at Brightmyst. He immediately realized that he never had time to
study the other side of the Fence, the one facing away from village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looked in even worse shape. A dark mold was growing up the posts, nearly
covering the runes, and wood everywhere was crumbling apart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

had already started
to attack by the time Brynn made it down the palisade with the others. It was
early, just before noon. Kodroth hadn&amp;rsquo;t kept his word, evidently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsIt&#34;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;t was twilight&lt;/span&gt;
by the time Brynn returned to
the village. To his surprise, he encountered a flurry of activity in the village
square. Guards were handing out crude spears and shovels to anyone able bodied
enough to hold them, while others were carrying stacks of sharpened logs down to
the docks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A passing guard told Brynn that the mayor was in a long house that served as the
community center. The soldiers at the entrance to it waved him through without a
word. Inside, wooden benches that normally filled the interior were pushed to
the side. Mayor Rhoddri stood at the center, surrounded by several sergeants of
the guard. He was giving them orders about setting up a defensive line at the
docks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as Brynn stepped inside, Rhoddri paused and focused on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So, Druid, do you know how to fix the Fence?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

of the Fence. It was a
simple wooden structure that surrounded the village.  Faded runes were carved on
each of the posts, similar to the ones he saw on the statue in the village
square. The whole thing was slowly rotting away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsBr&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;rynn staggered off&lt;/span&gt;
the small fishing vessel
and onto the docks of Brightmyst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A summer storm to the south had caused huge swells on their voyage, leaving
Brynn sea sick. The fishermen had expected him to cast healing magic on himself,
but Brynn had yet to learn those rituals, and besides the rocking boat would
have made them difficult to cast in any case.  Instead, he had laid down,
useless, in the hold, while they went about their business.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SPOILER ALERT:&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m using this page to track progress in my game. Read
this only if you want some hints to the story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brynn&#34;&gt;Brynn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brynn is a druid from the Druidic College of Galdir and the protagonist of our

&lt;p&gt;Brynn can sense the magical world much like a person hears, sees and smells.
Druidic scholars believe that all people are born with this ability, but because
humans are non-magical by nature, most can&amp;rsquo;t recognize it and even fewer can
master it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is a dark and stormy night. The tavern door slams open, the cold, the wind and the rain
breaching the warmth and coziness of the inn. A flash of lightning reveals the silhouette of a
traveller in the doorway.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, not a traveller. An &lt;strong&gt;adventurer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hail, and well met&amp;rdquo;, says the innkeep. &amp;ldquo;What would you like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Stories&amp;rdquo;, replies the adventurer. &amp;ldquo;Stories to tell. Stories to learn. Let us trade.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
