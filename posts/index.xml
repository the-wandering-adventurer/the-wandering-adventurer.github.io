      <title>Chapter 12</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsPu&#34;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;uffy white clouds obscured&lt;/span&gt;
the top of the
mountain. It was the tallest of the trio known as the Trinity. They were named
Abon, Nabuma, and Khazu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brynn was traveling down Abon, the largest of the three. During the winter
solstice, the sun would set directly over the mountain&amp;rsquo;s peak when viewed from
Galdir&amp;rsquo;s market square. The yearly event inspired many stories about the
romantic relationship between the Sun and the Earth. The event was one of the
most celebrated festival days of the year in Galdir, with people throughout the
Realm converging on the market square to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Chapter 11</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsHe&#34;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;e was in a void,&lt;/span&gt;
falling, falling, falling. A
numbness took hold. A finality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then he hit bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brynn expected a bone-crunching impact, but instead he landed with a damp
squelch at the bottom of a muddy pit. He lay there momentarily, devoid of all
thoughts, staring up past the opening of pit, looking at the eerie ceiling of
Grimcairn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsBr&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;rynn&#39;s knees buckled,&lt;/span&gt;
causing him to awkwardly
drop Seleeku down onto the cold stone floor of Grimcairn. He was dimly aware of
his surroundings. A large round room, barren except for a lidless empty stone
coffin in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was blood. Too much blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seleeku&amp;rsquo;s eyes opened ever so slightly, thin slits just enough to expose clouded
pupils. She spoke a word so faintly that Brynn wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure he heard it or
imagined it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her eyes closed. Was she still breathing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No-no-no-no &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Brynn kept repeating the word as if it might stop what was
happening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Chapter 9</title>
      <link>https://the-wandering-adventurer.github.io/posts/chapter-9/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsBr&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;rynn stayed focused&lt;/span&gt;
on Grimcairn as he walked
across the field, trying his best not to the let the gloomy spirits influence
his emotions. As he approached the great mound of stones, he saw that it was
even larger than he realized. To his surprise, the spirits of the individual
rocks had somehow been convinced to stick next to each other. These magical
forces were the only thing stopping the structure from crumbling into the
ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer absurdity of it left Brynn astounded. Communicating with rock spirits
was usually futile. A rock&amp;rsquo;s thought processes&amp;mdash;if you could call them
that&amp;mdash;extended into eons. A mortal&amp;rsquo;s entire life was the merest blip in time to
them. Finding a mutual common ground to understand each other was next to
impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet somehow countless numbers of stones had been convinced into forming
Grimcairn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsYo&#34;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;ou brought back&lt;/span&gt;
a &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt;?” Nessana spat
the last word vehemently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He was in the Hollow&amp;rsquo;s Glade, Scout Leader,&amp;rdquo; Seleeku replied. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;d have been
corrupted if I didn&amp;rsquo;t get him out of there. Once he saw me, what choice did I
have but to bring him here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He could be corrupted already!&amp;rdquo; Nessana shouted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Corrupted? Look at him! Does he look corrupted to you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsTh&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;he spirits can speak&lt;/span&gt;
to you?” Seleeku
asked, her voice a mix of suspicion and awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sometimes,&amp;rdquo; Brynn replied. &amp;ldquo;But just because they can speak to me doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean
I can understand them.&amp;rdquo; He crouched down to inspect the dagger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quarterstaff tapped him on the shoulder. &amp;ldquo;You better not pick that up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsDo&#34;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;o you two&lt;/span&gt;
know each other?” Seleeku
asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, not really.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It sure seems like it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It must be mistaking me for someone else.&amp;rdquo; Somehow, Brynn was sure that the
bonewalker thought he was Kodroth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So, are you going to talk to it, or what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsAn&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;n elf? It was still dark,&lt;/span&gt;
but the moon
provided enough light for Brynn to make out the silhouette standing before him.
A women with sharp features and pointy ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An elf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Am I still dreaming?&amp;rdquo; asked Brynn, sleepily. Elves were long gone. How could
she be here?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsBr&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;rynn stepped past&lt;/span&gt;
the Fence and turned for one
last look at Brightmyst. He immediately realized that he never had time to study
the other side of the Fence, the one facing away from village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looked in even worse shape. A dark mold was growing up the posts, nearly
covering the runes, and wood everywhere was crumbling apart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsKo&#34;&gt;K&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;odroth and the raiders&lt;/span&gt;
had already started to
attack by the time Brynn made it down the the palisade with the others. It was
early, just before noon. Kodroth hadn&amp;rsquo;t kept his word, evidently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsIt&#34;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;t was twilight&lt;/span&gt;
by the time Brynn returned to
the village. To his surprise, he encountered a flurry of activity in the village
square. Guards were handing out crude spears and shovels to anyone able bodied
enough to hold them, while others were carrying stacks of sharpened logs down to
the docks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A passing guard told Brynn that the mayor was in a long house that served as the
community center. The soldiers at the entrance to it waved him through without a
word. Inside, wooden benches that normally filled the interior were pushed to
the side. Mayor Rhoddri stood at the center, surrounded by several sergeants of
the guard. He was giving them orders about setting up a defensive line at the
docks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as Brynn stepped inside, Rhoddri paused and focused on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So, Druid, do you know how to fix the Fence?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsBr&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;rynn stood in front&lt;/span&gt;
of the Fence. It was a
simple wooden structure that surrounded the village.  Faded runes were carved on
each of the posts, similar to the ones he saw on the statue in the village
square. The whole thing was slowly rotting away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Prologue</title>
      <link>https://the-wandering-adventurer.github.io/posts/prologue/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcaps dropcapsBr&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;smallcaps&#34;&gt;rynn staggered off&lt;/span&gt;
the small fishing vessel
and onto the docks of Brightmyst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A summer storm to the south had caused huge swells on their voyage, leaving
Brynn sea sick. The fishermen had expected him to cast healing magic on himself,
but Brynn had yet to learn those rituals, and besides the rocking boat would
have made them difficult to cast in any case.  Instead, he had laid down,
useless, in the hold, while they went about their business.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
