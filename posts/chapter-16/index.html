His hands were free of the manacles, but he was still in his cell. The cell’s heavy door stood ajar.\nBrynn heard a murmur behind him. He turned in the direction of the voice. Sibila lay on the ground, mumbling to herself, staring up at nothing. He tried to listen to her words, but the sounds were nothing more than incoherent gibberish. He turned some more and froze.\nKynan’s lifeless body was crumpled to the ground, limbs askew, her face set in an expression of shock and horror.\nBrynn involuntarily scrambled up and backed away and gagged. He quickly scanned the rest of the room. Themon was gone. There was no trace of him. He had either run away or the Darkness had taken him.\nBrynn’s stats so far:\nHealth (3) Spirit (0) Supply (2) Momentum (-3) Shaken I haven’t been doing a good job in keeping track of vows, progress, experience, etc. Because of all that’s happened to him, I’m just going to advance him and give him a new asset: Fated\nBrynn could not bear to look at Kynan, but maybe he could help Sibila. He tentatively took a step towards her. She continued muttering, ignorant of his presence. He went to take another step when movement by the door interrupted him. He reflexively raised his arms into a defensive position.\nA familiar figure stepped in, carrying a lamp and a coiled length of old, rotted rope.\n“Seleeku?”\n“You’re up!” she replied, the relief evident on her face. She tossed the rope to the ground. “I thought I was going to have to drag you out of here.”\n“What happened?” Brynn asked. She was wearing a jailor’s uniform, but still had the wimple on her head, hiding her ears.\n“Everyone saw the guards arrest you. I followed you to this dungeon’s entrance. Sneaking into here was difficult, more difficult than the college, but I was eventually able to get an old jailor’s uniform. Then I had to wander around searching for you. They put you in the deepest, darkest cell for some reason. When I found you, you were unconscious, and they were …” she trailed off. “The key for your manacles was hanging just outside the door, but you wouldn’t wake up.” She looked down at the rope skeptically. “I thought maybe I could put this around you somehow and pull you out.”\nBrynn turned back to Sibila. “We have to help her.”\nSeleeku stepped forward and stopped him. “I tried, but there’s nothing to be done. The jailors will be here soon. They’ll get help for her. We can’t be here when they arrive.”\nShe was right, of course. Not only did everyone think he was corrupted, but now he would be considered a murderer too. Brynn risked a glance at Kynan. He had not known her very well, but he had heard that she had been a kind and intelligent person. She did not deserve what happened to her. No one did. He started crying.\n“I’m sorry, Brynn,” Seleeku said sadly. “We have to leave.”\nSwear an Iron Vow +heart\nStop Kodroth from destroying the world\nExtreme\nHit: 6 + 2 = 8 vs 2 | 5 +2 Momentum (-1) He stifled his tears and nodded. He did not have time for grief. He had work to do. He had to find a way to stop Kodroth, to stop the Darkness. He needed a way to learn their weaknesses.\nHe had a book to read.\nSeleeku had stashed another jailor’s uniform in a nearby empty cell. Brynn reluctantly abandoned his druid’s robe for the uniform. It was ill-fitting—too tight around the waist and voluminous around the shoulders—but it would work as a disguise as long as other jailors didn’t scrutinize him too closely.\n“The book that you stole, do you have it?” Brynn asked her as struggled into his new clothes.\nShe looked at him suspiciously. “I didn’t steal it. I borrowed it.”\n“You borrowed—? Never mind. The book, where is it?”\n“I put it back.”\n“You what?!”\n“I just said that I borrowed it. Besides, you told me that I should put it back, remember?”\nBrynn shoulders slumped. Seleeku grabbed the top of the tunic to stop it from slipping down to his elbows.\n“We need that book, Seleeku,” he told her.\nShe gave him a hard stare.\n“I’m sorry!” Brynn replied. “I didn’t know it at the time.”\nSeleeku shook her head silently and stepped out of the cell. Brynn followed her. This area of the dungeon seemed abandoned. Some of the rough-hewn tunnels had collapsed, creating a maze of passageways. Any cells they passed by were empty. Their contents had long since rotted away to dust.\n“Why did you rescue me?” he asked her while they paused at an intersection. She seemed unsure which way to go.\n“Isn’t it obvious that I need your help?” she replied, annoyed, and stalked off down the left tunnel. “I need your help in stopping the Darkness. More importantly, I need your help in saving Nessana.”\nHe hesitated before asking. “Is it one of your prophecies?”\nI have no idea what her prophecy is, so I’m going to roll for Brynn’s portion of it.\nOracle roll for action/theme:\nRoll 22: Preserve Roll 68: Portent (I admit that I rolled a few times to get something that sounded interesting.)\nShe stopped abruptly and pointed at him. “Preserve portent!”\n“Huh? What are you saying?”\n“That’s part of the prophecy. The part about you.”\n“That’s it? It doesn’t make any sense!”\n“Who says it has to make sense?” Seleeku replied. “We can talk later. Right now we have to find our way out of here.” She looked about the tunnel, as if searching for clues to their whereabouts.\n“Are you lost?”\n“No, of course not,” she replied curtly. She turned around and looked backwards, frowning.\nCan Brynn remember the way back?\nGather Information +wits\nMiss: 1 + 3 = 4 vs 8 | 5 (The 1 wouldn’t count because his momentum is -1, not that it makes a difference) Pay the Price:\nRoll 57: It causes a delay or puts you at a disadvantage. Brynn had travelled through these corridors when the jailors took him to his cell. He finally paid attention to his surroundings to see if anything looked familiar. The right wall was smooth stone, with delicate inlaid flower motifs. The left was simply unfinished rock. Half of the floor was made of cobblestones arranged in a complicated pattern that never seemed to repeat, while the other was muddy dirt. It was as if some sorcery had smashed two different corridors together.\n“I wonder what happened here,” said Brynn, slowly.\n“This dungeon must be cursed,” Seleeku replied. “I’m surprised I found you.”\nBrynn groaned. “It’s probably easy to get to the cell. It’s getting out that’s hard.”\n“Did your druids put a spell on this place? Can you reverse it?” she asked.\n“My druids?” he said reproachfully. “No, this dungeon has been here for ages. Who knows who created it? It could have been elves for all I know.”\n“What’s that supposed to mean?”\n“Humans and elves lived here in harmony long before the Great War! Anybody could have enchanted these corridors! I have no idea who created it or how.”\nSeleeku have him a biting look and headed back to the intersection they had been at moments before. They arrived at a grand underground hallway instead, with several corridors and tunnels branching off in different directions. Seleeku cautiously entered and the entire cavern glittered from the light of her lantern.\n“What is this?” Seleeku asked in wonderment.\nLarge twinkling pillars held up a lofty ceiling. Brynn could barely see it in the distance. He heard the occasional plop as a drop of water fell into one of the small puddles scattered around the floor.\nBrynn got closer to one of the pillars and looked at the blue white stone. “I think it’s salt.”\nSeleeku came up to him, and the light revealed the bones of a skeleton half-embedded in the column. Had the pillar of salt grown up around it? Could it have been there that long?\nShe moved her lamp around, examining the skeleton. Most of the skull was sunk into the salty stone, but it appeared to peering upward, its mouth open in a silent scream. Brynn followed its gaze. Were those arm bones sticking out above its head? Were the person’s arms raised upwards when this happened, pleading for mercy?\n“Any ideas?” Seleeku asked.\nBrynn shrugged. “There must be a ritual to reveal the true path, known only to certain jailors and the High Druids.”\n“Do you think the spirits can help us?” She looked around as if expecting spirits to pop out of the nooks and crannies of the cave.\nBrynn will attempt to “awaken” one of the columns, in hopes that it can help them escape.\nAwakening +Heart\nMiss: 2 + 2 = 4 vs 5 | 10 Mystic Backlash: Roll 64: Your ritual affects the target in an unexpected and problematic way. Brynn wanted to tell her that the spirits were the ones that created this maze and that they’d be unlikely to help. One glance at her face changed his mind. She was hiding it, but she was afraid. He was too. They could easily die here and end up like the poor soul embedded in their salty tomb.\n“I’ll try,” he replied.\nAny spirit that may have inhabited the skeleton had long since fled to a presumably more pleasant place. No one really knew what happened to a person’s spirit, or soul, when they died. A very few stayed on as bonewalkers, ghosts, or hollows—or haunted people’s dreams like Kodroth. Most disappeared from the realm, never be heard from again. Did they go to some form of heaven or hell? Who knew? The living asked for aid and comfort from the deceased through rituals and prayers. The dead rarely replied.\nSeleeku cleared her throat. “If you’re staring at that skeleton because you think it knows a way to escape, I highly doubt it.”\n“Not the skeleton,” Brynn said. “What’s behind it.”\n“The pillar?” she asked dubiously. The base was made of compressed salt, large, round and knotted. It rose up high into the distance, tapering in the middle before expanding again towards the ceiling. Seleeku raised her lantern in an attempt to see the top, but it stayed hidden in the shadows.\n“Maybe …” Brynn muttered to himself. The spirit of the pillar ignored Brynn and Seleeku completely. How could he reach something so foreign to his existence?\nHe tried anyway. “Oh great spirit of salt, could you show us how to leave these caves?” Seleeku looked at him and suppressed a laugh.\nThe spirit slowly awakened, but Brynn could tell something was wrong. It hardly noticed him or Seleeku, but instead felt the great weight of the cavern ceiling pressing down upon it. How long had it been here, deep underground, while the weight of the world crushed its spine? Why should it stay? It wanted to be free, free, FREE.\nThe ground shuddered as Brynn heard a great cracking sound from above. Little pebbles showered down around him. Then he heard thumps of larger rocks slamming into the floor.\n“Run!” shouted Seleeku.\nFace Danger +1 edge to avoid the falling rocks\nHit: 4 + 1 = 5 vs 1 | 2 +1 Momentum (0) Another crack shook the cavern. The pillar had broken in half and the top part was beginning to tumble down. Brynn bolted after Seleeku towards one of the outgoing corridors. Rocks and falling stones crashed all around him. White salty dust swirled over everything, choking him and obscuring his vision. He chased after the bouncing light of the lantern. He saw Seleeku dodge a plummeting column and jump into a tunnel. Brynn stumbled in after her.\nThe cavern collapsed with an ear-splitting boom. Rocks and columns roared down, filling the tunnel entrance with moon colored debris. There was no going back.\n“Oh great spirit of salt? Really?” Seleeku grumbled.\nA low moan echoed through the corridor.\n“Are you hurt?” she asked, concern suddenly entering in her voice.\n“No, that wasn’t me,” Brynn replied. They both looked down the corridor, which was little more than a roughly hewn tunnel. It looked like an abandoned offshoot of a salt mine, Brynn thought grimly, which could mean the tunnel could wind up being a dead end.\nThey had no choice but to move forward.\nThe faint wailing continued as the picked their way through the tunnel. They half walked, half climbed, as the tunnel twisted up and to the left. When they rounded the corner, they encountered the source of the whimpering.\n“High Druid Themon!” Brynn exclaimed.\nThe old man sat on the ground, his back propped up against the jagged wall and his legs splayed out on the floor. His unfocused eyes stared up at the ceiling. A feeble keen escaped his lips.\nBrynn looked him over. There was no blood or other signs of injury. He tentatively reached out and touched Themon’s shoulder. “High Druid!” he called.\nThemon’s gaze floated over to Brynn. “I’m sorry …” he whispered. “Take …” His eyes wandered to the dagger at his waist.\n“We’ll find a way out of here, High Druid,” Brynn said. “We’ll get you help!”\nThemon shook his head slightly. A single tear streaked down his cheek. “Modos … tednuj … meg …,” he sighed. He exhaled his last breath and was still.\n“No!” Brynn gave the man a gentle shake, as if to wake him, but it was no use.\n“Who was he?” Seleeku asked quietly.\n“He was a High Druid from the College. He saved my life when I was child. The book you stole—”\n“—borrowed—”\n“—belonged to him.” Brynn’s thoughts were a jumble. His emotions threatened to overwhelm him. “He and Sibila and Kynan … the ritual … affected him … he fled and wound up here …”\nSeleeku gave him a sympathetic look. “What were his last words? They sounded like gibberish to me.”\nBrynn took several deep breaths and settled himself. With shaky hands, he tenderly untied the belt around Themon’s waist. He needed to retrieve the dagger. “He was speaking in the Old Tongue.” His voice cracked, but he as able to keep speaking. “It’s the beginning of an ancient poem. There are no translations, unfortunately.”\n“I recognize that dagger,” Seleeku said, frowning.\n“The bonewalker we encountered in the swamp had a similar one.” He studied the hilt. The runes were unrecognizable to him, and he couldn’t sense any magic on the dagger. He wrapped the belt around his waist and did his best to hide it under his tunic.\nThe dagger is obviously important to Brynn’s quest, although I have no idea how.\nReach a Milestone:\nStop Kodroth: Seleeku seemed to be on the verge of saying something about the dagger, but she changed her mind. “We still need to find a way out of here,” she said instead.\nBrynn hesitated. If he left Themon here, he doubted he would ever be found. There was no way to carry him, however. Brynn would have to leave him to his fate. For now.\n“High Druid,” he spoke as he stood up. “I swear to you that I will find a way to give you proper funeral. I don’t know how, but I will make it happen.”\nSwear an Iron Vow +heart\nHave a proper funeral for High Druid Themon\nFormidable\nWeak Hit: 5 + 2 = 7 vs 2 | 8 +1 Momentum (1) Both Seleeku and Brynn shared a moment of silence. Then they looked ahead in the only direction they could go. Seleeku’s lantern illuminated the tunnel for a short distance. It continued upwards and then took another sharp turn, this time to the right.\n“Ready?” asked Seleeku.\n“Ready,” said Brynn. He wiped away a tear.\nThey stepped forward into the darkness.\n",

fixed to the ground,
flickered fiercely in front of Brynn&rsquo;s face. Its warm glow suffused the room. He
pushed himself up into a sitting position. His hands were free of the manacles,
but he was still in his cell. The cell&rsquo;s heavy door stood ajar.</p>
<p>Brynn heard a murmur behind him. He turned in the direction of the voice. Sibila
lay on the ground, mumbling to herself, staring up at nothing. He tried to
listen to her words, but the sounds were nothing more than incoherent gibberish.
He turned some more and froze.</p>
<p>Kynan&rsquo;s lifeless body was crumpled to the ground, limbs askew, her face set in
an expression of shock and horror.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Brynn involuntarily scrambled up and backed away and gagged. He quickly scanned
the rest of the room. Themon was gone. There was no trace of him. He had either
run away or the Darkness had taken him.</p>
<div id="" class="excursion">
<div class="inner">
<p>Brynn&rsquo;s stats so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Health (3)</em></li>
<li><em>Spirit (0)</em></li>
<li><em>Supply (2)</em></li>
<li><em>Momentum (-3)</em></li>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been doing a good job in keeping track of vows, progress,
experience, etc. Because of all that&rsquo;s happened to him, I&rsquo;m just going to
advance him and give him a new asset: Fated</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Brynn could not bear to look at Kynan, but maybe he could help Sibila. He
tentatively took a step towards her. She continued muttering, ignorant of his
presence. He went to take another step when movement by the door interrupted
him. He reflexively raised his arms into a defensive position.</p>
<p>A familiar figure stepped in, carrying a lamp and a coiled length of old,
rotted rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seleeku?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re up!&rdquo; she replied, the relief evident on her face. She tossed the rope to
the ground. &ldquo;I thought I was going to have to drag you out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Brynn asked. She was wearing a jailor&rsquo;s uniform, but still had
the wimple on her head, hiding her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone saw the guards arrest you. I followed you to this dungeon&rsquo;s entrance.
Sneaking into here was difficult, more difficult than the college, but I was
eventually able to get an old jailor&rsquo;s uniform. Then I had to wander around
searching for you. They put you in the deepest, darkest cell for some reason.
When I found you, you were unconscious, and they were &hellip;&rdquo; she trailed off. &ldquo;The
key for your manacles was hanging just outside the door, but you wouldn&rsquo;t wake
up.&rdquo; She looked down at the rope skeptically. &ldquo;I thought maybe I could put this
around you somehow and pull you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brynn turned back to Sibila. &ldquo;We have to help her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seleeku stepped forward and stopped him. &ldquo;I tried, but there&rsquo;s nothing to be
done. The jailors will be here soon. They&rsquo;ll get help for her. We can&rsquo;t be here
when they arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was right, of course. Not only did everyone think he was corrupted, but now
he would be considered a murderer too. Brynn risked a glance at Kynan. He had
not known her very well, but he had heard that she had been a kind and
intelligent person. She did not deserve what happened to her. No one did. He
started crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Brynn,&rdquo; Seleeku said sadly. &ldquo;We have to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<div id="" class="excursion">

<p>He stifled his tears and nodded. He did not have time for grief. He had work to
do. He had to find a way to stop Kodroth, to stop the Darkness. He needed a way
to learn their weaknesses.</p>
<p>He had a book to read.</p>
<hr>
<p>Seleeku had stashed another jailor&rsquo;s uniform in a nearby empty cell. Brynn
reluctantly abandoned his druid&rsquo;s robe for the uniform. It was ill-fitting&mdash;too
tight around the waist and voluminous around the shoulders&mdash;but it would work
as a disguise as long as other jailors didn&rsquo;t scrutinize him too closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The book that you stole, do you have it?&rdquo; Brynn asked her as struggled into his
new clothes.</p>
<p>She looked at him suspiciously. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t steal it. I borrowed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You borrowed&mdash;? Never mind. The book, where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You what?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just said that I borrowed it. Besides, you told me that I should put it back,
remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brynn shoulders slumped. Seleeku grabbed the top of the tunic to stop it from
slipping down to his elbows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need that book, Seleeku,&rdquo; he told her.</p>
<p>She gave him a hard stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; Brynn replied. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seleeku shook her head silently and stepped out of the cell. Brynn followed her.
This area of the dungeon seemed abandoned. Some of the rough-hewn tunnels had
collapsed, creating a maze of passageways. Any cells they passed by were empty.
Their contents had long since rotted away to dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you rescue me?&rdquo; he asked her while they paused at an intersection. She
seemed unsure which way to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it obvious that I need your help?&rdquo; she replied, annoyed, and stalked off
down the left tunnel. &ldquo;I need your help in stopping the Darkness. More
importantly, I need your help in saving Nessana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated before asking. &ldquo;Is it one of your prophecies?&rdquo;</p>
<div id="" class="excursion">
<div class="inner">
<p>I have no idea what her prophecy is, so I&rsquo;m going to roll for Brynn&rsquo;s portion of
it.</p>

<li><em>Roll 68: Portent</em></li>
</ul>
<p>(I admit that I rolled a few times to get something that sounded interesting.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>She stopped abruptly and pointed at him. &ldquo;<em>Preserve portent!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh? What are you saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of the prophecy. The part about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it? It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says it has to make sense?&rdquo; Seleeku replied. &ldquo;We can talk later. Right now
we have to find our way out of here.&rdquo; She looked about the tunnel, as if
searching for clues to their whereabouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; she replied curtly. She turned around and looked backwards,
frowning.</p>

<p>Brynn had travelled through these corridors when the jailors took him to his
cell. He finally paid attention to his surroundings to see if anything looked
familiar. The right wall was smooth stone, with delicate inlaid flower motifs.
The left was simply unfinished rock. Half of the floor was made of cobblestones
arranged in a complicated pattern that never seemed to repeat, while the other
was muddy dirt. It was as if some sorcery had smashed two different corridors
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what happened here,&rdquo; said Brynn, slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This dungeon must be cursed,&rdquo; Seleeku replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised I found you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brynn groaned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably easy to get to the cell. It&rsquo;s getting out that&rsquo;s
hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your druids put a spell on this place? Can you reverse it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>My</em> druids?&rdquo; he said reproachfully. &ldquo;No, this dungeon has been here for ages.
Who knows who created it? It could have been elves for all I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humans and elves lived here in harmony long before the Great War! Anybody could
have enchanted these corridors! I have no idea who created it or how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seleeku have him a biting look and headed back to the intersection they had been
at moments before. They arrived at a grand underground hallway instead, with
several corridors and tunnels branching off in different directions. Seleeku
cautiously entered and the entire cavern glittered from the light of her
lantern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; Seleeku asked in wonderment.</p>
<p>Large twinkling pillars held up a lofty ceiling. Brynn could barely see it in
the distance. He heard the occasional plop as a drop of water fell into one of
the small puddles scattered around the floor.</p>
<p>Brynn got closer to one of the pillars and looked at the blue white stone. &ldquo;I
think it&rsquo;s salt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seleeku came up to him, and the light revealed the bones of a skeleton
half-embedded in the column. Had the pillar of salt grown up around it? Could it
have been there that long?</p>
<p>She moved her lamp around, examining the skeleton. Most of the skull was sunk
into the salty stone, but it appeared to peering upward, its mouth open in a
silent scream. Brynn followed its gaze. Were those arm bones sticking out above
its head? Were the person&rsquo;s arms raised upwards when this happened, pleading for
mercy?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any ideas?&rdquo; Seleeku asked.</p>
<p>Brynn shrugged. &ldquo;There must be a ritual to reveal the true path, known only to
certain jailors and the High Druids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the spirits can help us?&rdquo; She looked around as if expecting
spirits to pop out of the nooks and crannies of the cave.</p>
<div id="" class="excursion">
<div class="inner">
<p>Brynn will attempt to &ldquo;awaken&rdquo; one of the columns, in hopes that it can help
them escape.</p>

<li><em>Mystic Backlash:</em></li>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Brynn wanted to tell her that the spirits were the ones that created this maze
and that they&rsquo;d be unlikely to help. One glance at her face changed his mind.
She was hiding it, but she was afraid. He was too. They could easily die here
and end up like the poor soul embedded in their salty tomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>Any spirit that may have inhabited the skeleton had long since fled to a
presumably more pleasant place. No one really knew what happened to a person&rsquo;s
spirit, or soul, when they died. A very few stayed on as bonewalkers, ghosts, or
hollows&mdash;or haunted people&rsquo;s dreams like Kodroth. Most disappeared from the
realm, never be heard from again. Did they go to some form of heaven or hell?
Who knew? The living asked for aid and comfort from the deceased through rituals
and prayers. The dead rarely replied.</p>
<p>Seleeku cleared her throat. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re staring at that skeleton because you
think it knows a way to escape, I highly doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the skeleton,&rdquo; Brynn said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s behind it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pillar?&rdquo; she asked dubiously. The base was made of compressed salt, large,
round and knotted. It rose up high into the distance, tapering in the middle
before expanding again towards the ceiling. Seleeku raised her lantern in an
attempt to see the top, but it stayed hidden in the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe &hellip;&rdquo; Brynn muttered to himself. The spirit of the pillar ignored Brynn
and Seleeku completely. How could he reach something so foreign to his
existence?</p>
<p>He tried anyway. &ldquo;Oh great spirit of salt, could you show us how to leave these
caves?&rdquo; Seleeku looked at him and suppressed a laugh.</p>
<p>The spirit slowly awakened, but Brynn could tell something was wrong. It hardly
noticed him or Seleeku, but instead felt the great weight of the cavern ceiling
pressing down upon it. How long had it been here, deep underground, while the
weight of the world crushed its spine? Why should it stay? It wanted to be free,
free, <em>FREE</em>.</p>
<p>The ground shuddered as Brynn heard a great cracking sound from above. Little
pebbles showered down around him. Then he heard thumps of larger rocks slamming
into the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; shouted Seleeku.</p>
<div id="" class="excursion">
<div class="inner">

<li><em>+1 Momentum (0)</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another crack shook the cavern. The pillar had broken in half and the top part
was beginning to tumble down. Brynn bolted after Seleeku towards one of the
outgoing corridors. Rocks and falling stones crashed all around him. White salty
dust swirled over everything, choking him and obscuring his vision. He chased
after the bouncing light of the lantern. He saw Seleeku dodge a plummeting
column and jump into a tunnel. Brynn stumbled in after her.</p>
<p>The cavern collapsed with an ear-splitting boom. Rocks and columns roared down,
filling the tunnel entrance with moon colored debris. There was no going back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh great spirit of salt? Really?&rdquo; Seleeku grumbled.</p>
<p>A low moan echoed through the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; she asked, concern suddenly entering in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that wasn&rsquo;t me,&rdquo; Brynn replied. They both looked down the corridor, which
was little more than a roughly hewn tunnel. It looked like an abandoned offshoot
of a salt mine, Brynn thought grimly, which could mean the tunnel could wind up
being a dead end.</p>
<p>They had no choice but to move forward.</p>
<p>The faint wailing continued as the picked their way through the tunnel. They
half walked, half climbed, as the tunnel twisted up and to the left. When they
rounded the corner, they encountered the source of the whimpering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;High Druid Themon!&rdquo; Brynn exclaimed.</p>
<p>The old man sat on the ground, his back propped up against the jagged wall and
his legs splayed out on the floor. His unfocused eyes stared up at the ceiling.
A feeble keen escaped his lips.</p>
<p>Brynn looked him over. There was no blood or other signs of injury. He
tentatively reached out and touched Themon&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;High Druid!&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>Themon&rsquo;s gaze floated over to Brynn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry &hellip;&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Take &hellip;&rdquo;
His eyes wandered to the dagger at his waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find a way out of here, High Druid,&rdquo; Brynn said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Themon shook his head slightly. A single tear streaked down his cheek. &ldquo;<em>Modos
&hellip; tednuj &hellip; meg &hellip;</em>,&rdquo; he sighed. He exhaled his last breath and was still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Brynn gave the man a gentle shake, as if to wake him, but it was no use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo; Seleeku asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a High Druid from the College. He saved my life when I was child. The
book you stole&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;borrowed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;belonged to him.&rdquo; Brynn&rsquo;s thoughts were a jumble. His emotions threatened to
overwhelm him. &ldquo;He and Sibila and Kynan &hellip; the ritual &hellip; affected him &hellip; he
fled and wound up here &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seleeku gave him a sympathetic look. &ldquo;What were his last words? They sounded
like gibberish to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brynn took several deep breaths and settled himself. With shaky hands, he
tenderly untied the belt around Themon&rsquo;s waist. He needed to retrieve the
dagger. &ldquo;He was speaking in the Old Tongue.&rdquo; His voice cracked, but he as able
to keep speaking. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the beginning of an ancient poem. There are no
translations, unfortunately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recognize that dagger,&rdquo; Seleeku said, frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bonewalker we encountered in the swamp had a similar one.&rdquo; He studied the
hilt. The runes were unrecognizable to him, and he couldn&rsquo;t sense any magic on
the dagger. He wrapped the belt around his waist and did his best to hide it
under his tunic.</p>
<div id="" class="excursion">
<div class="inner">
<p>The dagger is obviously important to Brynn&rsquo;s quest, although I have no idea how.</p>

</div>
<p>Seleeku seemed to be on the verge of saying something about the dagger, but she
changed her mind. &ldquo;We still need to find a way out of here,&rdquo; she said instead.</p>
<p>Brynn hesitated. If he left Themon here, he doubted he would ever be found.
There was no way to carry him, however. Brynn would have to leave him to his
fate. For now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;High Druid,&rdquo; he spoke as he stood up. &ldquo;I swear to you that I will find
a way to give you proper funeral. I don&rsquo;t know how, but I will make it happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both Seleeku and Brynn shared a moment of silence. Then they looked ahead in the
only direction they could go. Seleeku&rsquo;s lantern illuminated the tunnel for a
short distance. It continued upwards and then took another sharp turn, this time
to the right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; asked Seleeku.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; said Brynn. He wiped away a tear.</p>
<p>They stepped forward into the darkness.</p>
