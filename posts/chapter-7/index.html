  "articleBody": "The spirits can speak to you?” Seleeku asked, her voice a mix of suspicion and awe.\n“Sometimes,” Brynn replied. “But just because they can speak to me doesn’t mean I can understand them.” He crouched down to inspect the dagger.\nA quarterstaff tapped him on the shoulder. “You better not pick that up.”\n“Don’t worry,” Brynn said. “I’m not going to touch it. You shouldn’t either. It could be cursed.”\n“I’d still feel better if you weren’t so near it. What about the bonewalker? What did it tell you?”\nBrynn paused, standing up and stepping away from the dagger. The bonewalker implied he shouldn’t trust Seleeku. But why should he trust the bonewalker? It had been in league with Kodroth when it was alive.\n“Remember how I asked about another man who may have entered the forest? That man was called Kodroth the Quiet. Kodroth was the raider who attacked the fishing village I was in, the one that exiled me. In life, this bonewalker was a man named Arasen. He worked for Kodroth.”\nSeleeku poked at the bones with her staff. “And this Arasen was also exiled from your same village several years ago?”\nBrynn nodded. “I think he was the same man you mentioned drowning in the swamp. Kodroth sent Arasen to Brightmyst—that’s the village—on some sort of mission, but I don’t know what it was.”\n“Scouting for weak points?”\n“Possibly,” said Brynn, doubtfully.\n“I have more questions for you, Brynn, but we have to keep moving. There are other things in this swamp that could cause us trouble.”\nBrynn took one more look at the dagger. He wanted to study it more, but it didn’t feel safe to take it with them. He also had the feeling that the soul of Arasen was still out there somewhere, still searching for its redemption. He didn’t want to encounter it again anytime soon. He reluctantly started walking.\nThey traveled in silent alertness the rest of the way out of the swamp and were now at the edge of forest. Seleeku’s shoulders visibly relaxed.\n“What happened to you?” she asked. “You started muttering to yourself and then you seemed to blank out for a moment.”\nBrynn took a moment before answering. The sights and sounds of the forest were a welcome relief. He took a deep breath of fresh air and then replied, “The bonewalker made me relive a memory.”\n“Relive a memory? What does that mean?”\nBrynn kicked a pebble off into the woods. “I was living inside the memory, as if I was really there. Kind of like a dream, but more dangerous.”\n“Dangerous how?” Seleeku asked. She idly jumped onto and then over a tree trunk that fallen in their path. Brynn clambered over it with significantly less grace.\n“In all kinds of ways. Everything is more dangerous when dealing with spirits.”\nA crow cawed from a distant treetop, as if affirming Brynn’s answer. Seleeku continued with her questions. “So did it show you a memory from its past?”\n“Strangely, no. It showed me one of my own. Back when I was an apprentice at the College of Galdir.”\nSeleeku stopped at the mention of the name. “You are from Galdir?”\n“I didn’t grow up there, no. I was from a small village to the south. I studied in Galdir to become a druid.”\n“We have no love for that city. Nor of druids.”\n“The Great War was a long time ago, Scout Seleeku. Things change.”\nSeleeku grunted noncommittally. “What memory did it show you, Druid?”\n“I’m no longer a druid,” Brynn corrected her with a touch of wistfulness in his voice. “As to the memory—it showed me a time when I was an apprentice, practicing a ritual to trap a demon.”\nSeleeku gasped. “Your kind are still toying with demons? And you said that things change?”\n“Maybe you’re right,” Brynn admitted, “but at the time I had no way of knowing how dangerous they are.” That wasn’t entirely true. Even back then, he knew that demons weren’t to be trifled with. They were crafty and had an unnatural interest in mortal affairs. It was a bad combination for a spirit.\n“Demons,” grumbled Seleeku, but she said nothing further. They continued to trudge through the forest as the afternoon slowly went by. Brynn could sense that they were back on one of the elven trails.\nDemons. Brynn recalled how unnerved he had felt when the demon had centered its attention on him. I will show you where it all started, the bonewalker had told him. Could the demon be related to the Darkness somehow? A chilling scenario played in Brynn’s mind. Perhaps the demon had inspired High Druid Themon’s vision. Another druid was originally assigned to investigate, but she had become mysteriously ill. Perhaps the demon did that too, so Brynn was the only one available to travel to Brightmyst. But why would it be interested in him? Why would it send him here? And where did Kodroth fit into all of this?\nWhere does Seleeku take Brynn?\nOracle rolls for descriptor/location\nRoll 47: Mystical Roll 42: Rapids What does Seleeku do (action/theme)?\nRoll 56: Resist Roll 100: Supply Brynn’s thoughts were interrupted by a deep rumbling sound. Seleeku paid no attention to it and kept walking. A few minutes later, its source was revealed when the trail led to the edge of a raging river. Torrents of water clashed violently around large gray boulders, sending white spray swirling into the air. Brynn could sense the river spirit, strong and forceful, proud in its display of power.\n“Where do we go now?” Brynn shouted his question over the commotion.\nSeleeku didn’t answer him. Instead she stepped lightly over to the rocky edge of the river and knelt down. She began chanting a ritual in a language that Brynn didn’t recognize. It was obviously something that she was reciting from rote memory, for she sang it quickly and clearly, without pause. When she reached the end, the river’s power lessened by a small but noticeable degree. It was enough to reveal a set of wet boulders that wound their away across to the other side.\n“Now we cross,” Seleeku stated.\nHe stared at the slick stones. “Are you crazy? I’m not going on those!”\n“Brynn, you haven’t attempted to escape so far. I don’t know what you’re looking for exactly, but I believe you desire to meet my people to seek some answers. Are you going to follow me, or not?”\nShe hopped onto the first rock and danced across the stones with the expertise of someone who had done it many times before. She stood at the other side waiting for him.\nFace Danger +edge\nWeak Hit: 5 + 1 = 6 vs 10 | 1 Brynn’s stats so far:\nHealth (3) Spirit (1) Supply (2) Momentum (10) Since this is a weak hit, I’ll go with:\nMomentum -1 (9) Brynn carefully went to the edge of the river, watching the white water rush past. What would she do if he turned around and walked away? What would he do? He made his decision. He hesitated only a moment more before stepping carefully onto the first rock.\nHe immediately slipped and was on his hands and knees. Spray and foam soaked him completely.\nHe gritted his teeth and stood up. Even though Seleeku’s ritual had taken an edge off of the rapids, Brynn still felt tiny next to its fury. He needed to keep moving. He slowly made his way across, each boulder a new puzzle. Some were small, some were round and slippery, others too far away to reach easily. He crept and crawled his way among the rocks, making perilous leaps when he had to. The rapids thundered around him, grabbing at him eagerly, the ritual barely keeping them at bay.\nHe was almost there.\nHe was about to jump to the last stone when he heard a strange gurgling noise upstream. It was as if the river was signaling to Brynn that its patience had worn thin. Brynn hastily jumped onto to the rock and then onto shore. He scrambled up the river bank and plopped down next to Seleeku. He was wet, bedraggled and exhausted. Somehow, she had managed to stay completely dry.\n“I guess I’m going with you,” Brynn said breathlessly.\nAs if to emphasize the point, the river’s ferocity returned with a loud roar. It expressed its displeasure by pushing a wall of water downstream. Brynn heard a series of loud booms as the boulders that had made up the path tumbled out of sight.\nSeleeku scowled. “The Scout Leader won’t like that,” she said, more to herself than to Brynn.\n“What won’t I like?” asked a voice behind them.\nDescription of Scout Leader Nessana\nRoll 62: Honest Roll 33: Strong Is Nessana a woman?\nRoll 19: No Brynn and Seleeku both turned around. A tall and athletically built elven man was watching them carefully. He was flanked by a male and a female elf, each holding a bow with an arrow nocked and pointed at Brynn.\n“Scout Leader Nessana!” exclaimed Seleeku. Her face brightened and she smiled.\nNessana stared at Brynn. Brynn watched various emotions play across the elf’s face. Surprise, disgust, and then anger.\n“Scout Seleeku, what have you done!”\n",

to you?” Seleeku
asked, her voice a mix of suspicion and awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; Brynn replied. &ldquo;But just because they can speak to me doesn&rsquo;t mean
I can understand them.&rdquo; He crouched down to inspect the dagger.</p>
<p>A quarterstaff tapped him on the shoulder. &ldquo;You better not pick that up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Brynn said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to touch it. You shouldn&rsquo;t either. It

<p>&ldquo;Strangely, no. It showed me one of my own. Back when I was an apprentice at the
College of Galdir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seleeku stopped at the mention of the name. &ldquo;You are from Galdir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t grow up there, no. I was from a small village to the south. I studied
in Galdir to become a druid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no love for that city. Nor of druids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Great War was a long time ago, Scout Seleeku. Things change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seleeku grunted noncommittally. &ldquo;What memory did it show you, Druid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no longer a druid,&rdquo; Brynn corrected her with a touch of wistfulness in his
voice. &ldquo;As to the memory&mdash;it showed me a time when I was an apprentice,
practicing a ritual to trap a demon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seleeku gasped. &ldquo;Your kind are still toying with demons? And you said that
things change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Brynn admitted, &ldquo;but at the time I had no way of knowing
how dangerous they are.&rdquo; That wasn&rsquo;t entirely true. Even back then, he knew
that demons weren&rsquo;t to be trifled with. They were crafty and had an unnatural
interest in mortal affairs. It was a bad combination for a spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demons,&rdquo; grumbled Seleeku, but she said nothing further. They continued to
trudge through the forest as the afternoon slowly went by. Brynn could sense
that they were back on one of the elven trails.</p>
<p>Demons. Brynn recalled how unnerved he had felt when the demon had centered its
attention on him. <em>I will show you where it all started,</em> the bonewalker had
told him. Could the demon be related to the Darkness somehow? A chilling
scenario played in Brynn&rsquo;s mind. Perhaps the demon had inspired High Druid
Themon&rsquo;s vision. Another druid was originally assigned to investigate, but she
had become mysteriously ill. Perhaps the demon did that too, so Brynn was the
only one available to travel to Brightmyst. But why would it be interested in
him? Why would it send him here? And where did Kodroth fit into all of this?</p>

<p>Brynn&rsquo;s thoughts were interrupted by a deep rumbling sound. Seleeku paid no
attention to it and kept walking. A few minutes later, its source was revealed
when the trail led to the edge of a raging river. Torrents of water clashed
violently around large gray boulders, sending white spray swirling into the air.
Brynn could sense the river spirit, strong and forceful, proud in its display of
power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do we go now?&rdquo; Brynn shouted his question over the commotion.</p>
<p>Seleeku didn&rsquo;t answer him. Instead she stepped lightly over to the rocky edge of
the river and knelt down. She began chanting a ritual in a language that Brynn
didn&rsquo;t recognize. It was obviously something that she was reciting from rote
memory, for she sang it quickly and clearly, without pause. When she reached the
end, the river&rsquo;s power lessened by a small but noticeable degree. It was enough
to reveal a set of wet boulders that wound their away across to the other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we cross,&rdquo; Seleeku stated.</p>
<p>He stared at the slick stones. &ldquo;Are you crazy? I&rsquo;m not going on those!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brynn, you haven&rsquo;t attempted to escape so far. I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re looking
for exactly, but I believe you desire to meet my people to seek some answers.
Are you going to follow me, or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hopped onto the first rock and danced across the stones with the expertise
of someone who had done it many times before. She stood at the other side
waiting for him.</p>

<p>Brynn carefully went to the edge of the river, watching the white water rush
past. What would she do if he turned around and walked away? What would <em>he</em> do?
He made his decision. He hesitated only a moment more before stepping carefully
onto the first rock.</p>
<p>He immediately slipped and was on his hands and knees. Spray and foam soaked him
completely.</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth and stood up. Even though Seleeku&rsquo;s ritual had taken an
edge off of the rapids, Brynn still felt tiny next to its fury. He needed to
keep moving. He slowly made his way across, each boulder a new puzzle. Some were
small, some were round and slippery, others too far away to reach easily. He
crept and crawled his way among the rocks, making perilous leaps when he had to.
The rapids thundered around him, grabbing at him eagerly, the ritual barely
keeping them at bay.</p>
<p>He was almost there.</p>
<p>He was about to jump to the last stone when he heard a strange gurgling noise
upstream. It was as if the river was signaling to Brynn that its patience had
worn thin. Brynn hastily jumped onto to the rock and then onto shore. He
scrambled up the river bank and plopped down next to Seleeku. He was wet,
bedraggled and exhausted. Somehow, she had managed to stay completely dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m going with you,&rdquo; Brynn said breathlessly.</p>
<p>As if to emphasize the point, the river&rsquo;s ferocity returned with a loud roar. It
expressed its displeasure by pushing a wall of water downstream. Brynn heard a
series of loud booms as the boulders that had made up the path tumbled out of
sight.</p>
<p>Seleeku scowled. &ldquo;The Scout Leader won&rsquo;t like that,&rdquo; she said, more to herself
than to Brynn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What won&rsquo;t I like?&rdquo; asked a voice behind them.</p>
<div id="" class="excursion">
<div class="inner">
<p>Description of Scout Leader Nessana</p>

<li><em>Roll 19: No</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Brynn and Seleeku both turned around. A tall and athletically built elven man
was watching them carefully. He was flanked by a male and a female elf, each
holding a bow with an arrow nocked and pointed at Brynn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scout Leader Nessana!&rdquo; exclaimed Seleeku. Her face brightened and she smiled.</p>
<p>Nessana stared at Brynn. Brynn watched various emotions play across the elf&rsquo;s
face. Surprise, disgust, and then anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scout Seleeku, what have you done!&rdquo;</p>
